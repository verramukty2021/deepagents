r"""Runtime patches over Textual internals, imported for side effect.

This module hosts two independent best-effort patches over private Textual
APIs. Each guards its own import/assignment and degrades to stock Textual
behavior (logging a warning) if the targeted internals move, so they have
separate lifecycles — do not delete the whole file when only one lands
upstream.

1. Alt-modifier preservation on legacy `ESC + <byte>` sequences. Upstream
    `XTermParser._sequence_to_key_events` drops the `alt` flag on the
    tuple-branch fast path, so VSCode's `sendSequence` shift+enter binding
    (which writes `\x1b\r` to the PTY) arrives as bare `enter` instead of
    `alt+enter`. Tracked in Textualize/textual#6378. Remove this patch and
    the Textual pin comment in `pyproject.toml` when that lands.

2. Double-click word selection. Stock Textual selects the entire widget on
    a click chain; these patches narrow a double-click (and double-click
    drag) to word boundaries. No upstream issue tracks this yet, so it has
    no removal criterion — it stays until Textual grows native word select.

Imported for side effect from `app.py` before any `App()` is created.
