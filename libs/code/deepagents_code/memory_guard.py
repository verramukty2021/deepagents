"""Protect machine-managed memory blocks from agent edits.

The onboarding flow writes the user's preferred name into the user `AGENTS.md`
inside a marker-delimited block (see `onboarding.ONBOARDING_NAME_MEMORY_START` /
`ONBOARDING_NAME_MEMORY_END`). `MemoryMiddleware` strips HTML comments before
injecting memory, so the model never sees those markers and has no way to know
the region is off-limits. Since the same prompt tells the model to `edit_file`
that file to persist learnings, nothing stops it from rewriting the managed
block.

This middleware intercepts `write_file`/`edit_file` calls targeting the guarded
file(s). When a call would change or remove the managed block, the model's other
edits are kept (though surrounding whitespace may be normalized, and a fully
removed block is re-appended rather than restored in place) while the managed
block is restored, and an error is returned so the model learns the region is
machine-managed. When the block was altered but the restore could not be
completed, an error is still returned so the failure is never silent.
