> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The interactive coding agent moved.** As of `deepagents-cli==0.1.0`, this package contains only the deployment subcommands (`init`, `dev`, `deploy`). The interactive REPL — previously launched via `deepagents` — now ships as [`deepagents-code`](https://docs.langchain.com/deepagents-code) (`dcode`).

## Install

```bash
uv tool install deepagents-cli
```

You'll need a LangSmith API key with access to the Managed Deep Agents private
preview ([waitlist](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith-managed-deep-agents-waitlist)).
Export it before running any command, or put it in a repo `.env` or
`~/.deepagents/.env`:

```bash
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="..."
```

## Usage

```bash
# Scaffold a new project folder
deepagents init my-agent

# Register any MCP servers you intend to use (one-time, per workspace)
deepagents mcp-servers add --url https://tools.langchain.com \
                            --header X-Api-Key=$LANGSMITH_API_KEY \
                            --name Fleet

# init scaffolds an empty tools.json. Add tools that reference a registered
# MCP server's URL (otherwise the agent has no tools), e.g. the Fleet server
# registered above:
#   { "name": "read_url_content", "mcp_server_url": "https://tools.langchain.com",
#     "mcp_server_name": "Fleet", "display_name": "read_url_content" }

# Upsert the project as a managed agent on /v1/deepagents/*
cd my-agent && deepagents deploy
```

`deepagents init` scaffolds an empty `tools.json`, an example skill under
`skills/`, and an example subagent under `subagents/`; edit or remove them to
suit your agent. `tools.json` starts empty because every tool must reference an
MCP server that is already registered in the workspace
(`deepagents mcp-servers add`) — so a freshly scaffolded project deploys
without first registering a server.

New agents default to the `state` backend. To opt into a managed sandbox, set
`agent.json`'s `backend.type` to `sandbox` and configure
`backend.sandbox_config.scope` as `thread` or `agent`; `sandbox_config` can also
include sandbox policy IDs and TTL fields. The CLI does not create or run
sandboxes locally; sandbox lifecycle is handled by the Managed Deep Agents
platform.

```json
{
  "backend": {
    "type": "sandbox",
    "sandbox_config": {
      "scope": "thread",
      "policy_ids": ["policy-id"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Project layout

```text
my-agent/
  agent.json              # name, description, backend, runtime.model, permissions
  AGENTS.md               # system prompt
  tools.json              # tools the agent can call (optional)
  skills/<name>/SKILL.md  # frontmatter-tagged skills (optional)
  subagents/<name>/       # delegated subagent definitions (optional)
```

### Other commands

```bash
deepagents agents list                  # list workspace agents
deepagents agents get <agent_id>        # show one agent
deepagents agents delete <agent_id>     # delete an agent

deepagents mcp-servers list                  # list workspace MCP servers
deepagents mcp-servers add --url URL          # register a server
deepagents mcp-servers get <id|name|url>      # show one server
deepagents mcp-servers tools <id|name|url>    # list a server's tools
deepagents mcp-servers update <id|name|url>   # update server URL or headers
deepagents mcp-servers delete <id|name|url>   # remove a server
deepagents mcp-servers connect <id|name|url>  # start OAuth for a server
```

`get`, `update`, `delete`, and `connect` accept an MCP server's id, exact name,
or URL — a non-id value is resolved against `mcp-servers list` (URLs are matched
ignoring case and trailing slash).
